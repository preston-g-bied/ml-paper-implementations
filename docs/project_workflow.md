# Project Tracking

## Paper Implementation Workflow

Each paper implementation follows this workflow:

### 1. Research Phase
- [ ] Read and understand the original paper
- [ ] Find and review supplementary materials
- [ ] Research modern interpretations and implementations
- [ ] Create paper summary document
- [ ] Define scope and success criteria

### 2. Planning Phase
- [ ] Design implementation approach
- [ ] Identify datasets needed
- [ ] List required dependencies
- [ ] Break down tasks into manageable components
- [ ] Estimate time requirements

### 3. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Implement data loading and preprocessing
- [ ] Implement core algorithm components
- [ ] Write tests to validate implementation
- [ ] Debug and refine implementation

### 4. Evaluation Phase
- [ ] Run experiments
- [ ] Compare results with original paper
- [ ] Create visualizations
- [ ] Analyze performance and limitations
- [ ] Document findings

### 5. Documentation Phase
- [ ] Complete implementation README
- [ ] Document challenges and solutions
- [ ] Connect paper to broader ML context
- [ ] Prepare blog post (optional)
- [ ] Update main project tracking

## Time Management

- Allocate fixed time blocks for each implementation
- Set realistic deadlines based on paper complexity
- Track time spent on different phases
